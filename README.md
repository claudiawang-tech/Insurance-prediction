# Insurance Prediction Project
Allstate Claims Severity 
Create an algorithm accurately predicting claims severity

## Description
This is a previous recruitment prediction competition held by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity). 

Allstate invited machine learning practitioners to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity.

## Dataset
Each row in this dataset represents an insurance claim. 

**File descriptions**
* train.csv - the training set
* test.csv - the test set. You must predict the loss value for the ids in this file.
* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on the mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted loss and the actual loss.

## Model
Feature Engineering and XGBoost
